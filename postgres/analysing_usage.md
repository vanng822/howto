## Cache and its Hit Rate

```bash
SELECT
  sum(heap_blks_read) as heap_read,
  sum(heap_blks_hit)  as heap_hit,
  sum(heap_blks_hit) / (sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read)) as ratio
FROM
  pg_statio_user_tables;
```

The ratio should no less than 99%

## Index usage
```bash
SELECT
  relname,
  100 * idx_scan / (seq_scan + idx_scan) percent_of_times_index_used,
  n_live_tup rows_in_table
FROM
  pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE
    seq_scan + idx_scan > 0
ORDER BY
  n_live_tup DESC;
```

if you’re not somewhere around 99% on any table over 10,000 rows you may want to consider adding an index

## Index Cache Hit Rate

```bash
SELECT
  sum(idx_blks_read) as idx_read,
  sum(idx_blks_hit)  as idx_hit,
  (sum(idx_blks_hit) - sum(idx_blks_read)) / sum(idx_blks_hit) as ratio
FROM
  pg_statio_user_indexes;
```

Should also expect this to be in the 99% similar to your regular cache hit rate.
